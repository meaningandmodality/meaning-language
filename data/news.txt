Open house for new lab space | October 03, 2024 | The Meaning & Modality Lab and the Program in American Sign Language co-hosted an open house in our beautiful new work space at 1100 Mass Ave, where we welcomed the rest of our department, and the wider Harvard/local community, to learn more about what we do and how we combine the educational and research sides of understanding the incredible capacity of human language, spoken and signed. | |
