Hayley at EMNPL | 11/18/2024 | Our 5th year PhD student Hayley Ross presented her paper "Is artificial intelligence still intelligence? LLMs generalize to novel adjective-noun pairs, but donâ€™t mimic the full human distribution", co-authored with Kate Davidson and Boston University's Najoung Kim, at the GenBench workshop of the EMNLP conference in Miami, where her paper won the best paper award of the workshop! Huge congrats, Hayley!|ross-awardceremony1.jpg | alt=Hayley, a young white woman, holding her diploma 
Open house for new lab space | 10/03/2024 | The Meaning & Modality Lab and the Program in American Sign Language co-hosted an open house in our beautiful new work space at 1100 Mass Ave, where we welcomed the rest of our department, and the wider Harvard/local community, to learn more about what we do and how we combine the educational and research sides of understanding the incredible capacity of human language, spoken and signed. |openhouse.jpg |alt=a series of photos of people in the lab common area sitting and standing around, decorating pumpkins and signing to each other.
Ankana, Hayley, Yagmur, and Kate give talks at ELM| 06/20/2024| The third Experiments in Linguistic Meaning (ELM) conference at Penn was held June 12-14, and featured three talks from our lab: Ankana Saha and Yagmur Sag presented a talk on "Mandarin demonstratives as strong definites: An experimental investigation" (co-authored with Jian Cui and Kate), Hayley Ross presented a talk on "Fake reefs are sometimes reefs and sometimes not, but are always compositional" (co-authored work with Najoung Kim at BU and Kate), and Kate Davidson presented an invited talk on "Semantic/pragmatic universals and variation via crosslinguistic experimentation". We had fun soaking up the most recent work in our growing interdisciplinary field that connects natural language semantics with philosophy, cognitive science, computation, and psychology, and of course spending time in beautiful Philadelphia with old and new friends/colleagues!|ELM3.jpg|alt=A photo of a building with a glass facade and the liberty bell inside it
