Hayley at EMNPL | November 18, 2024 | Our 5th year PhD student Hayley Ross presented her paper "Is artificial intelligence still intelligence? LLMs generalize to novel adjective-noun pairs, but donâ€™t mimic the full human distribution", co-authored with Kate Davidson and Boston University's Najoung Kim, at the GenBench workshop of the EMNLP conference in Miami, where her paper won the best paper award of the workshop!
